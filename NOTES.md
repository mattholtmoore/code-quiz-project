[*] Create function for View High Scores screen.  
<!-- I want to have the Top 10 high scores listed on this screen rather than the Submit High Score screen. Make necessary changes to current JS functions as needed. --> DONE


[*] Create a "Play Again?" button option appear on the Submit High Score screen.
<!--  make a “Go Back” link/button available so that the user doesn’t have to go to the top and hit refresh every time to play again. --> DONE


[*] Make View High Score button display none when the timer starts. 
<!-- Have it reappear when the Submit High Score screen shows up. --> DONE

_________________________________________________

[*] TOMORROW: Decipher issue with question/answer flow. I answer X amount of questions and the game freezes me out before I can finish my time.
<!-- Examine and debug code as needed to correct this. It seems to only allow me to get to 900 points max. This should not be the case.  -->

[*] TOMORROW: Dive back into CSS and refactor/style the "Go Back To Welcome" button and the "Play Again" button
<!-- Mimic the styles of the other buttons and this should suffice. Simple is strategy. -->

[] TOMORROW: Reconfigure Submit Score functionality.
<!-- After further consideration, I don't want to see the highscores on the submit score page. I want to only see them after accessing them through clicking the View High Score button -->

[*] TOMORROW: Complete the comments in my JS file. 
<!-- Make it simple and succinct. -->

[*] TOMORROW: Had an accidental commit take place. Not really sure how to fix it at the moment. 
<!-- Make sure commit hasn't derailed my progress so far. -->
